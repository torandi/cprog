intro: |
  You wake up with a terrible headache. You're not sure what happend yesterday, but you got a feeling you really messed things up.
  You have a wague memory of a curse and.. What? What is this place?

  You have no memory of this old shack, but it's probably yours.

  Well, you belive it was you who caused all the problems, so you might just get to fix it.

  When the monster draws it final breath you feel the presure over your chest lift, and the forest feels brighter.
  You have lifted the curse!

  Thanks for playing, come again.
  Now get me some coffee.
